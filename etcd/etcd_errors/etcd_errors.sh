If etcd runs low on storage space, it raises a space quota alarm to protect the cluster from further writes. So long as the alarm is raised, etcd responds to write requests with the error mvcc: database space exceeded.

In RHOCP 4.x, history compaction is performed automatically every five minutes and leaves gaps in the back-end database. This fragmented space is available for use by etcd, but is not available to the host file system. You must defragment etcd to make this space available to the host file system.

Starting in RHOCP 4.9.z, defragmentation occurs automatically."

During the leader election the cluster cannot process any writes. Write requests sent during the election are queued for processing until a new leader is elected. Until a new leader is elected, we are going to observe instabilities, slow response times and unexpected behaviors affecting RHOCP control plane."
